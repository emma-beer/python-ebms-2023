# python-ebms-2023

Python code to run and plot:

(1) an idealized energy balance model (EBM) model with thermodynamic sea ice, seasonal variations, and two ocean layers, as in:
Beer, Eisenman, and Wagner (2020). Polar amplification due to enhanced heat flux across the halocline. Geophysical Research Letters 47, e2019GL086706.

(2) an idealized energy balance model (EBM) model with two ocean layers, and a vertical heat flux that depends on the precense of sea ice (defined as when the surface temperature is below freeezing), as in:
Beer, Eisenman, Wagner and Fine (2023). A possible hysteresis in the Arctic Ocean due to release of subsurface heat during sea ice retreat. Journal of Physical Oceanography, 53(5), 1323â€“1335.
